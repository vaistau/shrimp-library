            <i>Shrimp Library</i> is a repository of random, highly specific
            knowledge gathered by a group of nifty ladies who decided to share
            it with the world. All the advice is tailored for women to meet
            their unique needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name <i>Shrimp Library</i> comes as a result of internal jokes
            and memes. The point of this website is to try to ease women's
            lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            We've all been through various bad experiences, and we survived, so
            we're here to help other women who might be going through the same
            in a way that will simplify the process. Learn from other people's
            mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>In other words: Shrimple as.</p>
